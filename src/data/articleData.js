            text: "Keeping seeds continually moist but not overly wet can be difficult, and without sufficient moisture, seeds will not germinate. Start by moistening the soil thoroughly the day before you sow your seeds. If you live in a region where summers are typically dry, set up a sprinkler, and connect it to an automatic timer. A tried-and-true way to keep carrot seeds moist until they germinate is to rest a layer of moist burlap or row cover fabric over the soil until seedlings appear."

Generally speaking, seeds germinate well when nights are consistently above 50°F, but there are exceptions. Spinach, for example, needs cool soil, and eggplants, peppers, and melons prefer warm soil. Time your planting accordingly, or germinate seeds indoors, where you can control the temperature."

Slugs, snails, and crickets dine on seeds and seedlings, cucumber beetles can make squash seedlings disappear overnight, and ants will carry your seeds away to their underground stash. What to do? Try a second sowing, and cover it with row cover or burlap to exclude such pests as crickets and cucumber beetles. Iron phosphate baits such as “Sluggo” and “Escar-Go!” deter slugs and snails, and are harmless to pets and people. If beet or chard germination is a problem, try setting mousetraps. For ant problems, rimming your row with baking soda or a string soaked with citrus oil may help. Or, rearrange your plantings so that direct-sown seeds are in areas with minimal ant activity."

Good soil preparation, and the addition of generous amount of compost, will solve many soil problems. A soil test will give you a complete picture of the structure and quality of your soil."
